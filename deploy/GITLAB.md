# Self-Hosting GitLab — the Individual's Host, Seated Honestly

The founder's order: let's self-host GitLab. The house's own law
answers first, and it is obeyed, not waived:

## The seating (the law applied to ourselves)

The record holds: *open source, self-hosted, is a vulnerability — of
the seating, not the code: the layer runs with its contract seat
vacant... open-source hosting needs an agency.* Self-hosting GitLab
is lawful here for exactly one reason: the agency exists and takes
the seat — unboxd holds the hosting contract for this layer, in its
own name, with the answering priced and the exit real. The
vulnerability the law names is not waived but staffed: breaches at
this layer escalate to a named party (the agency, today resolving to
the founder — the contacts table governs), and the layer is kept
like every kept thing: pinned, patched on cadence, drift-audited.

One more honesty, recorded because honest words demand it: GitLab is
the textbook open-core company — the model this house's own
licensing decision critiques. The pick survives the critique because
of what we take from it: the CE core (MIT) serving git — and git's
own law is the exit: every clone whole, the canon never hostage to
its host. We run GitLab as a serving layer, never a residence; the
open-core risk is contained to a layer we can leave in an afternoon.

## The picks, pinned

- **GitLab CE**, self-hosted, pinned to an exact release at install
  (point of reference, official: https://docs.gitlab.com/install/ —
  collated, not restyled; record the version you stand on the day
  you stand on it).
- **Ground:** the declared stack — the VPS rung (deploy/VPS.md) or
  the estate (deploy/STACK.md); GitLab Omnibus on Ubuntu LTS for the
  single machine, the official Helm chart on the cluster.
- **The registry stays zot** — one custodian per function: GitLab's
  bundled container registry is disabled; zot (already picked, CNCF)
  holds the images. GitLab hosts the record; zot holds the artifacts.
- **No additional DB — the DB stays in the kube.** The founder's
  law, applied here exactly: the stack gains no new database seat.
  GitLab requires PostgreSQL and Redis to exist — and they exist as
  internal organs of GitLab's own kube (the Omnibus bundle keeps
  them inside the box: not provisioned, not exposed, not on the
  stack's deconstruction, no separate layer with a separate
  contract). The deconstruction's storage seats do not grow by one;
  a database that never leaves its kube is not a stack component
  but an implementation detail behind a sealed face — keep the DB
  in the kube, and the kube keeps the DB invisible.
- **The fabric is the DB — the destination, declared.** For the
  fabric's own products the rule is absolute from day one: no
  additional database, ever; the record is the store, the kube
  carries its own state (the way the cluster's record is etcd and
  the box's record is its manifest), and FabricDB — the declared
  seat, durable, indexed, replicated, meta-modeled — is the one
  store the fabric builds when the founder gives the build order.
  GitLab is a guest with its organs sealed inside it; the fabric's
  own organs are the fabric's own, and there is exactly one of
  them.
- **CI:** .gitlab-ci.yml at the repo root — the gauntlet ported:
  same make targets, same verdicts, test/security/eval reports as
  artifacts, the promise check before anything ships. The portability
  claim, no longer a claim.

## The name

git.unboxd.cloud — the founder's ruling, and the seating says why:
the agency holds the hosting contract, so the host wears the
agency's name — a function subdomain under the org's domain (the
domain is the org; the function is the prefix). The individuals keep
their own homes (kubecontainer.xyz points at its repo within), but
the serving layer is the agency's seat and carries the agency's
name.

And the agency's faces multiply by function, each a subdomain under
the one domain, the founder naming them as they are needed:

- **git.unboxd.cloud** — the source host (GitLab CE, the record).
- **developers.unboxd.cloud** — the developer portal: where Any'One'
  building on the fabric arrives — the docs collated, the blueprints
  to copy, the SDK and the handed-over binaries (HomeSetup and its
  kin) to download, the control panel (the edge-as-UI-ref), the
  references and the FAQ. The face the field of study and the field
  of work meet at: study the docs, take the blueprint, download the
  pack, build your home. It is the agency's seat (the contract is
  the agency's), served by its own kube, behind the same cert-manager
  issuer as every face — one more function subdomain, the domain
  still the org.

Each subdomain is a face of the one canonical identity (the resolution
layers: the DID at unboxd.cloud, the subdomains its recorded
projections), never a second org — git for the record, developers for
the builders, more as functions are named, all resolving home.

## The walk (the founder's hand, paste-ready)

    # on the declared Ubuntu ground, per the official docs:
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates
    curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://git.unboxd.cloud" apt install gitlab-ce=<PINNED-VERSION>
    # register a runner for the gauntlet (official: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)
    # mirror the canon: GitLab is the home, GitHub remains a mirror —
    # push both remotes; every clone is whole either way.

## The exit (always)

`gitlab-ctl backup` + the git remotes themselves: the canon lives in
every clone, the issues and CI history are the host's context (the
NOTICE discipline: decision-bearing context is absorbed into the
canon as it happens, so losing a host loses conversation, never
canon). Uninstall is one package removal; the record walks out the
door whole, as designed from the first principle.
