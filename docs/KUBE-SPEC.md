# The Kube — Product Specification

Status: v1, normative. Terms used here are defined in
[AGENT-PLATFORM.md](AGENT-PLATFORM.md) and governed by
[FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md](FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md). The reference
implementation is this repository's `KubeContainer` (v0.1.0, released).

## 1. Definition

A kube is the platform's unit of product: a declared outcome, kept by an
autonomous loop, presenting one contractual face to the world, with its
provenance attached. It is whole and indivisible — there is no fraction
of a kube — and it is what a customer buys, what the registry records,
what the surface is tiled from, and what the fabric packs.

One sentence for the buyer: *you declare what you want; the kube makes
it true, keeps it true, proves it was true, and answers for it.*

## 1a. Meaning and measurement

A kube is a box with meaning (what it is) and a measurement (how much it
is worth). Both are expressed in real-world, internationally accepted
standards by default; where none exists, the contract holder defines and
delivers the measure explicitly, marked as holder-defined. The BOM/SCM
carries no prior transaction before the end-user touch point. Full rule:
[MEASUREMENT-STANDARD.md](MEASUREMENT-STANDARD.md).

## 2. Anatomy

Every kube consists of exactly five parts; remove any one and it is not
a kube.

| Part | What it is | KubeContainer v0.1.0 instance |
|---|---|---|
| Declaration | The spec: intent in schema, validated before admission | The `KubeContainer` CR (CEL-validated) |
| Loop | The autonomous keeper: observe, compare, act, record | The reconciler (level-triggered, idempotent) |
| Face | The one stable surface point it answers at | `status.endpoint` (Service/Ingress) |
| Record | Its state, history, and evidence, externalized | spec/status in etcd; events; conditions |
| Contract | The promises, with their verdicts named in advance | Ready/Progressing/Degraded; the gauntlet |

## 3. Lifecycle

Declare → Admit → Converge → Serve → Evidence → Exit.

1. *Declare:* the principal states the outcome (file, CR, request).
   Vague intent is returned for definition, not guessed at.
2. *Admit:* schema validation, policy, authorization — the gates. A
   kube that cannot be admitted does not partially exist.
3. *Converge:* the loop closes the distance to the declaration, one
   adjacent step at a time, without jumps.
4. *Serve:* the face answers — stable, minimal, guarded. The kube is
   now load-bearing at its point of the surface.
5. *Evidence:* continuously — status reflects truth, events record
   actions, verdicts accumulate in the record. Done is only ever
   claimed by citing a verdict.
6. *Exit:* graceful by design — work landed or released, state
   committed, the face handed over or retired, the name and record
   surviving the instance.

## 4. Guarantees (each with its verdict)

| Guarantee | Verdict that proves it |
|---|---|
| Declared state converges | Ready condition; e2e gate (real traffic) |
| Drift is reverted | Reconcile on child mutation (tested) |
| Valid once, valid forever | Golden compat corpus (append-only, CI-enforced) |
| Nothing rides alongside | One workload container; no sidecars (tested) |
| One writer per field | HPA non-interference (tested) |
| Provenance attached | Evidence report shipped with every release |
| Clean removal | Owner-reference garbage collection (tested) |

A guarantee without a listed verdict is a roadmap item, not a guarantee.

## 5. Interfaces

- Declarative: `kubectl apply` of the CR — the only required interface;
  works on any conformant Kubernetes cluster.
- Observational: `kubectl get` (printer columns), status conditions,
  events, Prometheus metrics.
- No proprietary wire, no required CLI, no console dependency: the API
  is the product surface; consoles and tools are adapters.

## 6. Non-goals (what a kube is not)

- Not a template engine, not a package manager, not a PaaS console.
- Not a fraction: there are no partial deployments of a kube, no
  degraded tiers sold as whole ones.
- Not a cage: deleting the declaration removes the kube cleanly; the
  record of it remains (exit ends the acting, never the accountability).

## 7. Conformance (what may call itself a kube)

A thing is a kube if and only if:

1. its outcome is declared in a published schema and validated at
   admission;
2. an autonomous loop keeps it, and the loop survives restart with
   nothing lost (state external, ACID);
3. it presents one identified, stable face, owned by exactly one
   contract;
4. every guarantee it claims names the verdict that proves it, and the
   verdicts run in CI or in cluster — not in slideware;
5. its history is recorded, append-only, and attached to what it
   delivers.

KubeContainer v0.1.0 conforms (verdicts in §4). Future kinds — Release,
SolidStateDatabase, agent workloads — must clear the same five clauses
before wearing the name.

## 8. The product line

The kube is the unit; products are counts and kinds of kubes:

- One kube: the pilot (the MVP — the whole thesis at quantity one).
- Many kubes, one tenant: the estate (governance, drift audits, eval
  registry over their workloads).
- Many kinds: the platform (new CRDs clearing §7).
- Many tenants, many fabrics: the economy (federation, certification,
  the partner network).

Scaling is packing, not rebuilding: the difference between MVP and
platform is count, not kind.

And the product line gains its edge edition, named by the founder
on the Ubuntu Core precedent: **KubeContainer Core** — the kube at
the device's core, as a product. The minimal, sealed distribution
of the container runtime for edge devices: the operator and the
one-kube communicator packaged as the immutable center of a device —
the loop, the record, the contract, and the single signed channel,
nothing else aboard (Single Binary Code as a product SKU). The
surface around it stays headless; the core inside it runs the kube;
delivery reaches it only at the ports — the whole edge doctrine,
shipped as the thing you flash. Where KubeContainer runs workloads
on clusters, KubeContainer Core *is* the workload-keeper a device
boots: edge with kube at its core, in the catalog — and its name,
given by the founder, is **The Metal Kube**: KubeContainer Core is
what it ships as; The Metal Kube is what it is.

## 9. The brand

The brand line is the founder's, recorded verbatim with his styling:
**Kube — the soul of Any'Thing'**.

The claim is mechanical, not mystical, and every word of it is already
load-bearing in this spec:

- A *Thing* is any identifiable artifact at a touch point of the
  surface, real or digital (lexicon: *Thing*). A Thing without a kube
  is a body — present, connected perhaps, and inert: no declared
  intent, no loop keeping it, no record surviving it, no one
  answering for it. The box as mere artifact.
- The *soul* is what the kube adds, and it is exactly the five-part
  anatomy of §2 read as the offices a soul has always been asked to
  hold: it *individuates* (the Declaration — this Thing's intent,
  distinct from every other's), it *animates* (the Loop — the Thing
  acts, keeps itself true, returns when struck down), it *faces the
  world* (the Face — one point where the Thing answers), it
  *remembers* (the Record), and it *answers* (the Contract). And it
  survives the body: exit ends the acting, never the accountability —
  the name and record outlive the instance (§3, step 6), which is the
  one property everything ever called a soul has been required to
  have.
- *Any* is the conformance clause (§7) read as the market: whatever
  clears the five clauses — workload, release, database, agent
  workload — gets a soul, and the product line (§8) is counts and
  kinds of ensouled Things.

The lineage is deliberate. The industry gave Things connectivity and
called it the Internet of Things — wired bodies, still soulless. The
kube supplies what the wiring never did, and the brand names the
consequence: give the Thing a soul and the Internet of Things becomes
the Internet of Agents. The phrase also honors its ancestor — *The
Soul of a New Machine* (Kidder, 1981) named the moment a built thing
first seemed to carry something of its makers; this brand makes that
metaphor checkable: the soul is five parts, listed in §2, each with a
verdict in §4.

Brand discipline: the protectable mark is the full line, never the
bare word — *soul* alone is unownable and is not claimed. The line is
claimed in NOTICE alongside the marks it extends, and defined in the
lexicon before use, per protocol P2.

## 10. The instruction manual

(The manual itself ships at `docs/manual/` — CONTRACTS, LICENSES,
FAQ, HOW-TO-USE; this section is the law it fulfills.)

The founder's shipping law: a product must be shipped with the
instruction manual — containing everything related to its lifecycle,
and the contacts of the people owning each aspect of its
performance. No kube leaves the dock without its book, and the book
has two halves, both mandatory:

- *The lifecycle, whole* — every stage of §3 written for the
  holder's hands: how it is declared, what admits it, how it
  converges, where it serves, what evidence it emits and where to
  read it, and how it exits — including the repair paths, the
  upgrade walk, the rollback, the destruct provisions if any (with
  their exit clauses), and the warranty's exact conditions (what is
  promised, under which conditions, to which tested bound). The
  manual is the declaration translated to the owner's language:
  everything the kube will do, before it does it.
- *The contacts, named* — for every aspect of the product's
  performance, the person or group owning it: who answers for
  availability, who for security, who for the supply chain, who for
  the keeping, who for the bill — each one a working contact (the
  owner rule: named, reachable, currently working; an org-box
  without a person is an empty seat printed in the manual). The
  manual is where the stack of contracts becomes a phone book: every
  seam's answerer, listed beside the seam.

A product without the manual is a box without its lid's writing —
the buyer holds the thing but not its contract; and a manual without
contacts is documentation without accountability, which this house
does not ship. The instruction manual is itself part of the BOM
(line-itemed, versioned with the product, updated by the same
gauntlet), so that what the buyer unwraps is never just the artifact
but the whole answering: what it does, how it lives, how it dies,
and exactly who picks up when any of that goes wrong.
