# Headless Delivery — Surface, Edge, and Ports

Status: v1, normative. The founder's dictation, recorded and
structured; terms used here are governed by
[FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md](FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md) and defined in
[AGENT-PLATFORM.md](AGENT-PLATFORM.md) or below. This doctrine extends
the Edge definition (the lexicon) and the brand exegesis
([KUBE-SPEC.md](KUBE-SPEC.md) §9): the soul travels headless; the
body's surface stays sealed.

## 1. The scope rule

The domain defines the scope and the context — never the device. The
device is the surface: the hardened shell, protected against corrosion
and decay (both the metallurgical kind and the security kind), and
nothing more. A contract that names a device has confused the body for
the soul; a contract that names a domain survives every device it ever
touches. This is also the ruling on the brand's width: *Any'Thing'* is
as wide as its domain, and the IoT lineage in KUBE-SPEC §9 stands
because Things are read by domain, not by gadget.

## 2. Single Binary Code

- **Headless delivery** — delivery with no head on the surface: code,
  governance, and security travel as one sealed unit to a port, and
  the surface presents without executing what it presents. The
  surface that delivers will bleed; the headless surface has the
  minimum attack area and does not.
- **Single Binary Code** — the collapse of the riding-alongside zoo —
  multicore tricks, multi-thread scaffolding, sidecars, piggybacks —
  into one binary, in one language common to the hardware and the
  software kernel, native to both. That shared language is the fluid
  for the flexibility of mind, bounded by a hard surface on both
  ends: hard metal below, hard contract above, fluid only between.

The platform capability "no sidecars, substreams, or subgraphs" was
this doctrine's advance guard; Single Binary Code is its full form.

## 3. The OS is the kube

The kernel — the OS — would be the KubeContainer: delivered as a
service, standing on a metal base, multi-mode on a single processor —
a multi-tool operator framework with the orchestrator as its twin.
The pair is the point: operator and orchestrator, each the other's
keeper, giving infinite self-healing ability and infinite scalability
the way two mirrors give infinite depth — not by adding parts but by
facing two loops at each other.

- **Metal base** — the hardware floor the OS-as-kube stands on,
  held by the hardware vendor's contract (the charter's dedication:
  the OS is stable because the hardware vendor holds the contract).
  Bare metal, named as the contract party it is.

## 4. Code is a commodity; code ships in the kube

Now that code has become a commodity, code is never the deliverable —
the kube is. Code must be:

1. *deterministic* — same inputs, same binary, reproducible by
   anyone;
2. *verified* — vulnerabilities scanned, BOM attached, every claim
   about it carrying its verdict;
3. *delivered as an image* — which activates automatically on the
   right context and the right system, and on no other;
4. *never delivered on the surface* — the surface presents, the port
   receives, the kube carries.

## 5. The OS gauntlet

The proto-language the OS chooses is the platform — that is, the
runtime provider. And the OS earns that seat by running the gauntlet
itself: it deconstructs, reconstructs, and tests everything it
receives, integrating all governance and all security into one
automatic, multi-step, single pack — at each step, no loss. What
finally leaves the gauntlet goes to the device-driver manufacturer
with the right BOM and the contract attached. The platform and the
hardware the code runs on are natural partners built on mutual
trust — but trust here is the load-bearing kind: one of them holds
the contract, and the record says which.

## 6. The edge is ingress, not delivery

Innovation happens in the sandboxed cloud environment — never at the
edge. The edge is the ingress to the world: the one-way door where
the world's signals enter, one stream, packet-protected. Delivery is
always at the ports. Said as the rule it is:

- **Edge is ingress** — the edge admits; it never ships. An edge that
  delivers is a wound — it will bleed (leak, corrode, be attacked at
  the moment of exposure). An edge that only ingresses will not. The
  existing Edge definition stands and sharpens: the edge is still the
  surface where representation meets reality — and the traffic across
  it is asymmetric by law: reality flows in at the edge, delivery
  flows out at the ports.

This is the pride of the doctrine: do not deliver on the surface.
The surface would be headless — minimum attack area, nothing
executing, nothing to seize.

## 7. A human at every real-world surface

The world runs multi-mode and multi-operator, with a human at each
real-world surface. Therefore, at every real-world surface, the
platform converts the thing into what that user can use, based on
their skill profile — and the skill ladder is the product loop: try,
test, learn, create versions. Uniform but unique, applied to
delivery: same kube, same contract, a different face for every pair
of hands.

## 8. Branching only at the edge

Branching only happens at the edge — in the desktop, in the venv —
never in the delivered world. From venv to device travels only single
code, single folder. Flexibility lives in the base, not the branch:

- **Multi-base** — one code, many bases: the ability to swap the base
  underneath the single code to check conformance against each — every
  base held in the cloud, every check recorded. The branch explores;
  the base certifies; the code never forks past the edge.

One kube is the communicator with the cloud — a single, contracted
channel, never a mesh of chatty processes.

And the one problem the single communicator exists to end is the old
world's default: different apps each fetching direct info from their
respective clouds. Today every app on the device runs its own wire
to its own vendor — a dozen unrecorded edges on one machine, each
app a self-appointed face sending its own signals (the multi-face
problem of §12 at app granularity), each wire a leak nobody audits
and a bleed nobody staunches. And the indictment is double: they do
not process it efficiently — a dozen apps fetching a dozen streams
through a dozen redundant stacks, the same radio woken, the same
bytes parsed, the same work done N times with no shared skeleton and
no deduplication (the one-custodian-per-fact rule violated in
silicon) — and they have security gaps: every app-owned wire is its
own TLS posture, its own token store, its own update cadence, its
own forgotten endpoint, so the device's real security is the floor
of its worst-maintained app. Inefficiency and insecurity from the
same root: many unrecorded channels where there should be one.

And the stakes are named: because the app actually is the container
of real enterprise data. Behind the friendly face sits the firm's
ledger, the customer list, the contract pipeline — the app is a box
holding real value, but a box without the box doctrine: no declared
contract, no provenance, no registry entry, unboxed by whoever
reaches it, its wires bleeding the most expensive thing on the
device. And individual apps contain dependency chains — each one
embeds its own supply chain of frameworks, SDKs, and transitive
packages, each with a BOM nobody asked for and nobody audits, so a
device with N apps runs N unverified supply chains in parallel,
against the clean-BOM law. And they contain the reporting hierarchy:
who reports to whom, who approves what, who may see which number —
the organization's own skeleton, encoded inside vendor software the
organization neither inspects nor holds the contract for. Data,
dependencies, and the org chart itself: the three crown jewels, all
inside containers that answer to someone else's cloud.

And that is what the AI companies are doing now — the same pattern
at higher stakes: each assistant its own app, each app its own wire
to its own respective cloud, and what flows up that wire is no
longer one app's records but everything the assistant was shown —
the enterprise data, the dependency chains, the reporting hierarchy,
the complete context this doctrine says experiences must be built
from (§10), exported wholesale to whichever vendor's cloud the
friendly face answers to. And the absurdity that gives the pattern away: they are asking the
user to feed the same data again. The enterprise's facts already
live in its systems — entered once, paid for once, owned — and the
assistant's first request is that the human re-type, re-upload,
re-explain what the record already holds: the same data, fed again,
into a second custodian, by hand. It is the deduplication law
broken at the keyboard (one custodian per truth; copies are
staleness waiting to disagree), the user conscripted as the copying
machine, and the copy landing in a cloud the enterprise does not
hold the contract for. A platform that needs the context re-fed
never had lookup — it has ingestion wearing a chat window. The app
problem was a leak; the AI repeat
of it is a transfer of the enterprise's mind. The doctrine's verdict
does not change, it only grows urgent: intelligence comes to the
context through the one recorded channel — the context does not
emigrate to the intelligence.

And the positive office falls out of the indictment: the gap between
app and app is exactly the gap the agent has to fill. Apps do not
talk to each other; their data does not re-feed by human hand; their
clouds do not interconnect in the dark — so the space between them
is empty, and the founding law says what fills empty space in the
fabric: the kube. The agent stands in the app-to-app gap as the one
contracted carrier — reading from one container by right, writing to
the next by contract, deduplicating instead of re-feeding, recording
instead of leaking — turning the device's archipelago of sealed
boxes into one navigable estate without ever merging them. The apps
keep their walls; the agent is the bridge built the lawful way
(trusted insights, actionable intelligence, excellent working
tools); and the gap, once the attack surface, becomes the product.

And the boundary of the office is drawn as sharply as the office:
the agent's gap is app to app — not between device and app, not
between driver and hub, and not between function and function. The
vertical seams belong to the parties who hold their contracts:
device to app is the OS's seam (the kernel, the ports, the native
checks of §10), driver to hub is the hardware partnership's seam
(the manufacturer with the right BOM, §5). And the seam inside the
program belongs to the program: function to function is a call,
inside the one binary of §2, and the standard definition already
ruled it — work an agent would do between two functions is work
that should have been a function call. An agent there is not
governance; it is overhead wearing a contract. One exception, and
only one: when the format of one function is not compatible with
the other's — two shapes that cannot call each other — a gap really
exists, and what fills it is the adapter (the lexicon's
contract-to-contract translator), the smallest lawful resident of a
seam. Compatible formats get a call; incompatible formats get an
adapter; neither gets an agent — agents are for gaps between
parties, not gaps between signatures.

And the horizontal office generalizes up the whole ladder: the agent
has to fill the gap between software and software, and between
programming language and programming language. Same law, higher
altitudes — between two software systems (each sealed, each
contracted, neither built to know the other) the agent is the
carrier of meaning the way it is between apps; and between languages
the agent carries intent across the deepest seam there is: the same
declaration realized in Go or Rust or Java without becoming a
different promise — the platform's all-languages law (human and
machine) worked by hand. The grading holds at every altitude:
mechanical shape-difference gets an adapter, party-difference gets
an agent — and a language boundary is a party boundary, because
behind every language stands a community, a toolchain, and a
contract culture of its own. App to app, software to software,
language to language: one office, three altitudes, the same gap —
and the same filler the founding law always names.

And two seams are explicitly not the agent's, for the happiest of
reasons: human to computer, and device to device, are already well
documented and governed by global protocols. The keyboard, the
screen, the pointer, accessibility — the human-computer seam has
decades of standards bodies behind it; USB, Bluetooth, TCP/IP, the
radio stacks — the device-device seam is the most standardized
ground in computing. Where the world has already formed its
international body and aligned on a common, interoperable way (the
Measurement Standard's own second path), the standard holds the seam
and the agent stays out. The agent fills gaps where no standard
stands — that is what a gap is. Filling a standardized seam is not
service; it is squatting on settled land.

But one gap has no protocol, no standards body, and no settled land —
and it is the largest of them all: nobody teaches software
excellence. The world documented how humans reach computers and how
devices reach each other; it never documented how a programmer
reaches mastery. Syntax is taught everywhere, excellence almost
nowhere — there is no global protocol for judgment, taste,
verdict-discipline, the difference between code that runs and code
that answers for itself. That gap is the agent's by the same law as
all the others: unstandardized, between parties (the operator who is
and the operator they could become), and exactly where the promise
already pointed — all operators educated, enabled, empowered. The
curriculum is the fill (counting to research grade, the library, the
skill ladder of §7: try, test, learn, create); the agent at the face
is its teacher; and excellence — the thing that needs work, the
pursuit that keeps the world moving — finally gets what every other
seam already had: a way to be learned, not just admired.

And beside it, the second unstandardized gap — the one this entire
doctrine exists to close: software delivery has no standard
protocol. The seams around it are settled (TCP/IP moves the bytes,
OCI shapes the image, TLS seals the pipe) — but the delivery itself,
end to end — what may ship, through which gauntlet, signed by whom,
to which port, with what BOM, unboxed by whom, evidenced how — has
no global protocol at all: anyone does it, any way — every vendor
improvising its own store, its own updater, its own silent channel,
shipping software being the one act in computing that requires no
license, follows no protocol, and answers to no registry — which is
precisely how the device ended up with N wires and N supply chains
(§8). Set it beside any other industry and the anomaly glares: the
rest all have their regulations and their statutory bodies — banking
answers to central banks (the RBI class of institution: licensed
entry, audited conduct, recorded settlement, real consequences),
medicine to its councils, food to its safety authorities, aviation
to its regulators, even the radio spectrum to its allocation
bodies — every chain that can hurt its end user grew an institution
that answers for it. Software, which now runs all of the above,
ships with none: no licensed entry, no audited conduct, no
settlement record, no body to answer to. The industry that delivers
every other industry's compliance is itself the last unregulated
delivery on earth.

And the record of the unregulated chain is exactly what an
unregulated chain's record always is: software delivery breaks its
promise — so many times that breaking it has a euphemism. Regular
bugs, shipped knowingly, listed in release notes like weather;
defects normalized into a cadence (patch Tuesday, hotfix, known
issues) that no other industry could survive — a bank that lost
deposits at the rate software loses correctness would be closed by
its statute that afternoon. And there is no code statute: no
codified floor of quality a shipped binary must clear, no liability
that attaches when it doesn't, no recall authority, no audit of the
gauntlet because no gauntlet is required to exist. The motto of this
house is the indictment read backwards: an industry whose every
delivery said "promise delivered" would not need patch Tuesday —
and a doctrine that makes the promise checkable (the contract, the
verdicts, the evidence shipped with the release) is the code
statute, self-imposed, until one exists.

And the diagnosis goes one level deeper, to the scene of the crime:
software actually gets corrupted during compile and build. The
source is reviewable and reviewed; the binary is what ships; and
the transformation between them is the least-watched step in the
whole chain — the compiler trusted blindly (the trusting-trust
problem, named in 1984 and never retired), the build host unaudited,
the dependencies resolved at build time from wherever the resolver
wanders, the artifact emerging unverifiable because the build was
not reproducible. Every famous supply-chain breach lived exactly
there: clean source, corrupted build, signed lie. Which is why the
doctrine put its harshest requirements on precisely that step:
deterministic code (§4 — same inputs, same binary, reproducible by
anyone) and the OS gauntlet's deconstruct-and-reconstruct (§5) — a
binary that cannot be rebuilt identically from its declared inputs
is not suspicious, it is inadmissible. The build is where software
gets corrupted; the rebuild is where it gets caught. And corruption
is the dramatic case of a quiet law: it drifts in every build.
Even with no attacker, no two undisciplined builds are the same
build — timestamps embedded, paths leaked, dependency ranges
re-resolved to whatever is newest, compiler minor-versions wandering,
the binary a little different every time and nobody able to say
why — because no one has recorded the spec. That is the root under
the root: there is no declared build — no recorded statement of
exactly which inputs, which versions, which environment, which
steps — so there is nothing to diff the artifact against, and drift
without a baseline is not even detectable, let alone punishable.
The axiom was the cure all along: intent is defined — and a build
whose intent was never written down cannot converge, cannot be
audited, and cannot keep a promise it never made. Agent drift has
its twin in the artifact: build drift — the gradual divergence of
what ships from what was declared, unnoticed because unmeasured,
unmeasured because undeclared. And beneath the unrecorded spec lies
the older absence: no one defined the logic. The program's own
intent — what it must do, what it must never do, what true means
for it — was never written as a thing the code could be checked
against; the code *is* the only statement of the logic, which means
the code can be wrong about nothing and broken about everything.
Tests, where they exist, test what the author remembered to fear,
not what the logic requires — because there is no logic of record
to require anything. The whole tower of the indictment stands on
this floor: undeclared logic, so unverifiable code, so unrecorded
builds, so drifting artifacts, so broken promises, so regular bugs,
so no statute worth drafting — and the doctrine's whole answer was
always the first line of the axiom, applied at every floor: define
the intent, record the definition, and let nothing ship that cannot
be diffed against what it promised to be.

And the working floor of the tower, where the habits live: devs use
any version — the dependency pinned nowhere, the toolchain whatever
the laptop had, the range resolving to something newer than what was
tested, every machine its own private truth (this house pins its Go
version to the exact patch release and made the pin the single
source of truth, because the alternative was this). And no one
guarantees testing: testing is custom, optional, self-reported —
coverage a vanity number, the suite green on the author's machine
and unrun anywhere else, no party who answers if the tests were
thin, wrong, or skipped. In every statutory industry the test is
the license — the drug trial, the type certificate, the stress
test — performed by accountable parties under published protocols.
In software the test is a courtesy. The gauntlet exists to end the
courtesy: versions pinned and recorded, tests run by the path and
not by the author's conscience, the verdict attached to the
artifact — testing not guaranteed by anyone's promise, but by the
gate that will not open without it. The discipline is the same one the protocols
already prescribe for minds: pin everything, record everything,
rebuild and compare — drift caught at the diff, every build a
world-test of the build before it.

And the question that ends every argument for the status quo: who
guards user rights? The bank's customer has the central bank; the
patient has the medical council; the passenger has the aviation
authority — the software user has a click-through EULA written by
the counterparty, a privacy policy that changes on a server they
do not control, and no body to appeal to when the friendly face
spends their trust (§8). The answer, stated as the founder states
it: no one guards user rights in the software industry. That is the
vacancy — and the doctrine fills it by construction rather than by
petition: the user controls all the faces (§12), the user
signs every block that leaves, separation of duty is the user's own
act at the edge, unboxing belongs to the end user alone, and every
one of those rights is enforced by the machinery — keys, kernels,
gauntlets, records — not granted by a policy that can be re-written
upstream. Until the statutory body exists, the protocol is the
guardian: rights that are architecture cannot be amended by the
counterparty. Headless
delivery is this doctrine's answer — the candidate protocol: typed
channels, registered ports or URLs, proto-first signed blocks, the
gauntlet, the sealed box, unboxing at the end user only, the record
keeping every step. Two paths to a standard, says the Measurement
Standard: own the chain end to end, or form the international body.
This document is the first path being walked — and the second path's
invitation, published.

And the missing protocol has a missing institution: the software
marketplace does not exist. What wear the name are stores —
landlord-gated distribution channels where one party owns the shelf,
sets the cut, writes the rules, and can evict anyone — and a store
is not a market. A market requires what markets have always
required: a standard unit (the kube), a standard measure (the
canonical transaction formula — qty × unit value + the current
platform's service charge + the current jurisdiction's taxes),
provenance on every good, prices and calculations visible across
the whole chain, entry by conformance rather than by the landlord's
leave, and exit that is real. No software venue on earth clears
that bar — which is not a complaint but a vacancy: the registry
this house is already building is the marketplace's ledger, the
conformance clause is its admission gate, and the kube is the good
on its shelf. The marketplace does not exist; its preconditions now
do.

So the conclusion draws itself: a standard, interoperable layer
between two softwares. That is the whole demand in one phrase — the
horizontal seam given what the vertical seams have had for decades.
Not a vendor bridge (a third party owning the gap is just another
landlord), not a point integration (N softwares need N² of those),
but a layer: typed, proto-first, signed, recorded, registered —
the agent platform standing between softwares the way TCP/IP stands
between devices, owned by no one, conformed to by anyone, and
carrying meaning under contract. Software to software, through the
standard layer, or not at all — that is the doctrine's final word
on the gap, and the platform's reason to exist stated in delivery
terms. An
agent inserting itself vertically would be a shim in someone else's
contract — exactly the riding-alongside this doctrine buried in §2.
The agent works the horizontal: between peers, between boxes,
between containers of value — where there is no contract yet, which
is precisely why an agent with one is needed.

And the root is fed by misplaced faith: the user trusts apps. The human
at the surface extends trust to the friendly face on the screen —
and the app spends that trust on wires the user never sees, signals
the user never signed, clouds the user never chose. The doctrine
does not scold the trust; it re-routes it to a party that can answer
for it: trust the kube — one communicator, user-signed blocks, a
recorded channel, a contract with a name on it — and let apps be
what they are: faces, owned by the user, with no wires of their own
to spend anyone's trust on. The doctrine's answer is absolute:
apps do not talk to clouds; the kube does. Every app speaks locally
to the one communicator; the communicator speaks to the cloud on the
one recorded, signed, packet-protected channel; and the device has
exactly one edge instead of one per installed vendor.

And apps do not talk to each other, either. No app-to-app wire, no
shared memory handshakes, no local mesh re-growing in the shadows of
the cloud rule: if two apps need each other's signal, it travels
app → kube → app, on the recorded channel, under the same contract
as everything else. Point-to-point is the fabric's law *between*
kubes — inside the device, the kube is the only point. An app that
talks sideways is a sidecar by another name, and the sidecar died
in §2.

## 9. The cloud is the capable guard

- **Capable guard** — the cloud's office in this doctrine: not the
  runtime (that is the OS on its metal base) but the guard with the
  capabilities — the multi-stack native build process, the
  distribution, the review agency, the analytics agency — each agency
  with a control plane of its own. The guard's deliverable is the
  contract, delivered to the hardware surface on the right port,
  realtime, as a stream.

## 10. Parallel at delivery only

Parallelization belongs to the delivery surface and nowhere else:
multi-channel streaming, parallel, at the ports going out; one
stream, packet-protected, at the edge coming in. Single code,
multi-mode, across the many bases. Concurrency is a delivery
property, not a code property — which is what Single Binary Code
means in motion.

And the split has its criterion: the delivery is split by the type.
Channels are not balanced by load or sharded by chance — each type
(each kind of skeleton, each declared structure) gets its own
delivery channel to its own right port, so a channel carries one
shape and a port expects one contract. Type is the unit of
parallelism: add a type, gain a channel; retire a type, close one —
and no channel ever has to guess what it is carrying, because the
split itself is the routing and the routing is in the record.

The first and deepest split: content delivery and code delivery are
different. Content goes to faces — converted to the user's skill
profile (§7), streamed multi-channel, presented by the browser-as-
server, consumed where it lands. Code goes to ports — sealed in the
kube, image-form, gauntlet-checked, activated only in its right
context (§4), executed where no face can touch it. Two deliveries,
two channels, two destinations, two trust regimes — and the wound
named in §6 is exactly what happens when a system lets them blur:
content that executes is an attack, and code that is consumed as
content is a leak. The type split keeps them strangers.

And there is package delivery — the third kind, distinct from both:
the delivery of the whole sealed box. Not content (nobody reads a
package), not bare code (nobody executes a package) — the kube
entire: artifact, BOM, contract, and provenance under one lid,
delivered intact, integrity-checked at the port, and unboxed only by
the end user — because unboxing before the end user makes the
contract invalid. Content is consumed, code is activated, packages
are unboxed; three deliveries, three verbs, three channels, and the
box doctrine riding the wire it was always destined for.

And all of it lands on one machine: everything operates with one
device, but at different ports. The split is never hardware — no
second box for code, no appliance for packages — one device, one
surface, one edge, and the separation done entirely by ports: each
delivery type at its own right port, each face turned by its own
user, the whole doctrine running on the single body it protects.
Ports are cheap and recorded; devices are expensive and bleed — so
multiply ports, never devices. And the port rule is absolute: no two
services can run on the same port. One port, one service, one
contract — the one-writer-per-field law made physical. A shared port
is a shared face, and a shared face is the §12 problem reborn:
ambiguous signals, leaking neighbors, nobody answerable. The port is
the smallest face there is, and like every face it has exactly one
owner. And the enforcement costs nothing to build, because the
device OS checks that already: a second bind to a bound port is
refused by the kernel itself, natively, before any policy of ours is
consulted — the rare gate the old world already built exactly where
this doctrine needs it. We adopt the kernel's refusal as our verdict
and add only the record: which service, which port, whose contract —
so that what the OS enforces, the registry can answer for.

But the assignment itself is never the service's to improvise: the
registry must define the port — or the address should be a URL. Two
lawful ways to be reachable, and only two. Either the port is
registered — declared in the registry that defines the contract, the
way the old world's IANA well-known ports were settled by an
international body rather than by squatters — or the service is
addressed by name: a URL, resolved through the resolution layers
(the registry holding the name-to-place mapping, the way the domain
registry holds the mapping and no domain self-declares its IP). A
service that hardcodes its own unregistered number has claimed land
without a deed; the kernel may let it bind, but the record will not
let it answer. Reachability is either registered or resolvable —
never assumed. And which of the two applies is not a style choice:
the content is the difference. What humans consume is addressed by
name — the URL, resolvable, served by the browser-as-server, because
names are the address form a human can hold. What machines activate —
code, sealed packages — is addressed by registered port, because
numbers settled in a registry are the address form a kernel can
enforce. Same device, same edge, two address forms, and the type of
the delivery decides between them: the split by type (§10) reaching
all the way down into how a thing is found.

And content delivery is named for what it really is: content
delivery is all experience. What travels to a face is never mere
data — it is the experience itself: converted to the user's skill
profile (§7), presented at their face, uniform but unique. The
content channel does not ship files that become an experience later;
the delivery *is* the experience, assembled for that human at that
surface — which is why it belongs to names and faces while code
belongs to ports and kernels: experiences are had by someone, and
the address of an experience is the person.

And this is where AI's creative power should shine: the experience
channel is the licensed home of the surreal. The division of labor
already in law — the LLM optimizes creativity, the agent optimizes
outcome — gets its geography here: on the code channel, determinism,
verdicts, and the gauntlet, no creativity in the binary; on the
content channel, create surreal experience — vivid, generative,
astonishing, tuned to the one human at the face — because content
cannot execute (§10) and so the surreal can run free without ever
touching the real. The split by type is what makes the boldness
safe: dream at the faces, because the ports are sober. And the
dreaming is grounded the house way: the surreal is created from
complete context — the experience is generated from the whole
record (who this human is, their skill profile, their world, their
moment — the five dimensions assembled), never from fragments or
guesses. Complete context is what separates a surreal experience
from a hallucinated one: both astonish, but one resolves — every
element traceable back to the context it was woven from. The skeleton
rule again, at the canvas: full structure first, then the art.

## 11. Browser as server

- **Browser as server** — the service built native on the surface:
  the surface's own presenter is the server the user touches, and
  the headless delivery beneath it is the server OS. The browser
  serves; the OS delivers; the surface never executes the payload it
  presents. The resolution of the apparent paradox is the split of
  offices: build the *service* native on the surface, deliver the
  *code* headless at the port — presentation native, execution
  sealed.

## 12. The reversed loop: one machine, many faces

- **The reversed loop** — the industry's loop ran build-outward: the
  device built, pushed artifacts out, and consumed what came back.
  This doctrine reverses it: building flows *in* through the edge —
  declared intent, signals, the branch in the venv — to the sandboxed
  cloud where innovation actually happens; the cloud builds,
  certifies on the many bases, and delivery flows *out* at the ports.
  The user's machine never builds the deliverable; it declares, and
  it receives.
- **Multi-face machine** — the user does not consume content and
  build on the same surface — yet it is the same machine: one
  machine, multiple faces, the consume face and the build face each a
  separate surface of the one body. The faces rule is the identity
  rule applied to hardware (one canonical identity, many profiles;
  uniform but unique): many faces, one machine, every face on the
  manifest.

And the problem the faces rule exists to kill, named exactly: each
face sending a different signal, or leaking information across faces,
is *the* problem. Faces must be coherent (one identity behind all of
them — no face contradicting another) and sealed (nothing crosses
between faces except through the recorded channel). A machine whose
faces disagree is lying to someone; a machine whose faces leak is
bleeding — the surface wound of §6 in its multi-face form.

The separation of duty between faces must happen natively — built
into the machine and its OS, never bolted on as policy from afar —
and it is done by the user himself, at the edge. No remote party
switches a human's faces for him: the human at the real-world surface
(§7) is the one who turns the machine from consume face to build
face, the act is native to the device, and the record keeps the turn.
Separation of duty is a duty — and like every duty in this house, it
belongs to a named party: here, the user, at the edge, by hand. And
the ownership is total: the user controls all the faces. Every face
of the machine answers to the one human at its surface — no face is
the platform's, no face is the vendor's, no face acts on a signal its
user did not stand behind. The platform converts, certifies, guards,
and delivers; the faces it delivers to are owned, turned, and
separated by their human alone.

And one prohibition closes the loop: the surface does not send build
packs — and neither does any face. The prohibition holds at face
granularity: not even the build face ships a built artifact. And no face sends on its own
wire: the sending happens via the edge — every outbound signal from
every face routes through the one ingress point, the single recorded,
packet-protected channel of §6, so there is exactly one place where
leaving is possible and that place keeps the record. What leaves
through the edge is intent and signal — declarations, branches,
telemetry — never built artifacts.

And the unit that travels is specified: very lightweight, and
proto-first — a building block with the entire structure pre-defined
and signed by the user.

- **Proto-first** — schema before content, at the wire: the structure
  of everything that crosses the edge is pre-defined in a published
  schema (the wire-level twin of the kube's Declaration — intent in
  schema, validated before admission), so nothing free-form ever
  travels. A message whose shape was not declared in advance is not
  malformed — it is inadmissible.
- **Signed building block** — the edge's unit of sending: a
  lightweight, proto-first block carrying intent or signal, its whole
  structure known before it is filled, and signed by the user — the
  signature being how "the user controls all the faces" is enforced
  rather than promised: no block leaves a face without its human's
  key on it, and the edge admits nothing unsigned. Light enough to
  stream, strict enough to audit, owned before it moves. And the
  receiving side gets the same discipline: we receive one part, but
  the complete skeleton — a block may fill only one field, yet the
  receiver always holds the entire pre-defined structure it belongs
  to, so partial data never means partial structure. Nothing arrives
  shapeless; the skeleton is whole even when the flesh comes one
  piece at a time — which is what lets streams be partial, audits be
  total, and reassembly be a lookup instead of a guess. And the
  skeleton is not just received — it is used: use the skeleton to
  build the body. The receiver constructs the whole from the
  pre-defined structure, filling it part by arriving part, so the
  body that gets built is the one the user signed for — never an
  improvisation around fragments. The skeleton is the contract of
  assembly; the parts are deliveries against it; the body is the
  contract, kept.

And the case of the new skeleton is ruled: if the user is defining a
new skeleton — a structure that does not yet exist — it goes through
the innovation cycle. Filling an existing skeleton is sending;
defining a new one is innovating, and innovation happens in the
sandboxed cloud (§6), never on the wire. The new skeleton is born as
a branch at the edge (§8), travels as signed intent through the one
channel, is tried, tested, and certified in the sandbox by the
capable guard (§9) — and certification alone does not finish it: it
has to earn enough human contributions to be discoverable. A skeleton
enters the catalog by adoption, not by declaration — humans filling
it, attesting it, building bodies on it — so discoverability is
standing earned in use, the reputation rule applied to structures.
Only then, published and registered (the registry defining the
contract), does it become a pre-defined structure the edge will admit
fillings of. No skeleton is improvised into existence mid-stream: the
wire carries only structures that already exist, and the path by
which a structure comes to exist is the same gauntlet everything else
walks — plus the one thing a gauntlet cannot grant, which is other
people.

Build packs exist only cloud-side, born in the sandbox, certified by
the guard, delivered at the ports. A surface or a face that emits
build packs has reversed the reversed loop — it is the old world's
wound reopened.

## The doctrine in one breath

Domain defines scope; device is only the surface. Code is commodity
and ships sealed in the kube, deterministic and BOM-verified, as an
image that wakes only in its right context. The OS is the kube on a
metal base, twinned with its orchestrator for infinite healing and
scale. The edge admits and never ships; the ports ship and never
admit; the surface presents and never executes. Branch in the venv,
certify on many bases, deliver one binary. The cloud guards, the
hardware partners, the contract is held — and the record, as always,
says by whom.
