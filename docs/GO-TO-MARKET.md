# Go-To-Market: Selling to Enterprises

The thesis in four words: *provenance is the product* (defined in
`AGENT-PLATFORM.md`). v0.1.0 is its first proof — the release shipped with
its evidence report attached, because the record of how an artifact earned
its way out is the one thing a customer cannot get anywhere else.

We are not open source (a license, not a model) and not open core (we
gate no features). We are **open-enterprise** (defined in
`AGENT-PLATFORM.md`): everything open, the enterprise itself is what is
commercial. The posture in four words: *everything open, but
commercial.* Open is
not a tier and commercial is not a fence — the same artifact is both:
free to take (Apache 2.0, no lock-in, exit real) and sold as a
business, because what is monetized was never the artifact — it is the
standing behind it: the verdicts, the underwriting, the certification,
the provenance. Open wins the adoption; commercial sells the trust;
neither subsidizes the other — they are the same motion seen from the
two sides of the contract.

The paradox to resolve: everything here is open — standards-based, no
lock-in, exit always real, the operator Apache-licensed. So what is sold?
The charter's answer: **openness is not what we give away; it is what we
sell against.** Enterprises do not buy software anymore; they buy what
they can defend to a board, a regulator, and an auditor. We sell exactly
that.

## What is sold (the offer stack)

1. *Contracted outcomes* (principle 14) — never licenses, never hours:
   "your declared workloads run, scaled, exposed, self-healing, at this
   SLO" — the spec is the order, converged state the delivery, status
   the receipt, the metered price tied to the outcome.
2. *Assurance* (principle 15) — the premium tier: we underwrite what we
   certify. SLO breached → consequences priced in advance. No one else
   will stand behind an agentic estate because no one else can measure
   one; our confirmation machinery is what makes the liability rational.
3. *Provenance & audit-readiness* (the registry) — the compliance
   product: every action attributable, every revision recorded, every
   projection replayable, intelligence provenance-gated. When the
   regulator asks "what did your AI do and why," our customer answers in
   minutes from the record. This is the wedge — security and compliance
   teams have budget, urgency, and no current answer.
4. *The governed runway for agentic work* — the stable OS: identity,
   policy (OPA), authorization (OpenFGA), drift protocols, vocabulary
   discipline — the difference between "we use AI agents" (shadow,
   sprawling, unaccountable) and "we operate an agentic enterprise."
5. *JIT multi-model economics* — eval-scored routing across all
   providers: measurable cost-per-outcome reduction, receipts included.
6. *Certification & the partner network* (the long game) — suppliers
   pay to clear the published bar; partners deliver through the network;
   we are the trust fabric, not the inventory.

## The platform-as-a-service stack (what the agency operates)

When the agency sells the cloud platform as a service, the stack is
open at every layer — no hyperscaler required, every substrate
swappable: OpenStack (OpenInfra Foundation) as the default
infrastructure-orchestration layer where the customer wants
self-hosted or hybrid IaaS — datacenters, sovereign regions, edge —
with Kubernetes (CNCF) above it and kubes above that; Apache
CloudStack served where a customer's estate already speaks it (the
founder's house judgment reordered the default — see
LICENSING-DECISION.md — without breaking substrate plurality): the
agency is substrate-plural by policy, the same Kubernetes contract
above either, because the IaaS layer is a provider choice, never a
fabric dependency. Neither is required: per the supply-chain policy, users
need nothing but a conformant Kubernetes cluster, wherever it runs —
the hybrid reach is the offer (any cloud, any premises, one fabric),
and an all-Apache, all-open stack is what makes "everything open, but
commercial" true from the silicon contract up. The same stack scales
down as deliberately as it scales out: the micro edge cloud,
platform-as-a-service at the smallest viable footprint — a shop floor,
a branch, a vehicle, a village — one small cluster, the same kubes,
the same contracts, the same evidence, synced to the record when
connectivity allows (the box was always designed to travel sealed and
answer locally: offline-resolvable identity, OLC-grade addressing,
verdicts that run where the work is). Edge is not a second product;
it is the same fabric at its smallest whole number — and the agency
operates it as a service from hyperscale to micro edge, one weave.

And every layer is pinned — provider and version, per the supply-chain
policy. What this repository verifies today, exactly: Kubernetes
1.35.0 (envtest and e2e), kind v0.32.0, Go 1.25.7, kustomize v5.8.1,
controller-gen v0.20.1, golangci-lint v2.11.4. What the agency pins
per engagement: the substrate provider and its exact version
(CloudStack or OpenStack, LTS releases only) are chosen at contract
time, named in the registry entry, gauntlet-verified on that exact
substrate, and changed only by the deprecation procedure — never by
drift. The rule is uniform from the operator's toolchain to the
customer's IaaS: no floating tags, no "latest", no unrecorded
upgrades — a version that is not pinned is a promise that is not made.

## Why openness closes enterprise deals (not despite — because)

- *Procurement:* no lock-in clears vendor-risk review; exit-with-
  provenance makes us the *low-risk* line item.
- *Security:* open standards, pinned supply chain, SBOM roadmap —
  auditable to origin.
- *Legal/compliance:* the axiom is a record-retention policy a counsel
  can love: intent, action, revisions, projections, ACID.
- *The board:* "we can leave any time, and while we stay, someone is
  liable for it working" — that sentence wins meetings.

## The motion (land → expand)

1. *Land: the scored assessment.* Sell what we already build for
   ourselves — conformance / convergence / drift / distance scoring of
   their current agent estate against the charter's bar (the XDM and
   SWE-bench assessments are the demo). Cheap, fast, produces a number a
   CISO circulates. The assessment's gap list is the proposal.
2. *Prove: one kube.* One governed workload (the operator pattern) in
   their cluster, on their cloud, world-tested, in the registry — the
   real-work rule means the pilot itself starts building their evidence
   base.
3. *Expand: the estate.* More kubes, the policy/authz layer, the eval
   registry on their own tasks, drift audits on cadence.
4. *Lock in the only honest way:* by being the record they would have
   to stop trusting to leave — and the assurance no one else will write.

## Pricing axes

Per-outcome metering (the registry prices it), assurance premium on top
(SLO-backed), assessment as fixed-fee entry, certification fees from
suppliers/partners at network scale. The free tier is the open core
itself — it is also the sales force.
