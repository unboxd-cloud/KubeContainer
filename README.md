# The Fabric

An intelligent operating system of work: declared outcomes, kept by
autonomous loops, woven from contracts, with provenance attached to
everything it delivers. The fabric is built from kubes — whole,
indivisible units of kept promises — and this repository contains its
first one, plus the constitution the whole weave answers to.

**KubeContainer** is that first kube: a Kubernetes operator where twelve
lines of YAML become a running, scaled, exposed, self-healing workload —
the reference implementation of the
[Kube product specification](docs/KUBE-SPEC.md), governed by the
[founding principles](docs/FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md). You declare what you
want; the kube makes it true, keeps it true, proves it was true, and
answers for it.

And KubeContainer is the box — the plain, graspable thing every
metaphor here reduces to. A declared boundary with work inside it,
whole and indivisible, stackable and packable, opaque about its
internals and contractual at its surface. The shipping container
organized the physical economy by making every cargo the same shape to
every crane; the KubeContainer does the same for work — one schema to
every fabric, one contract to every operator. unboxd, because the value
was never the box: it is what declaring the box sets free. And the box
is real: v0.1.0 ships it — an actual image, with digests, carrying its
own evidence — work that crossed the surface and held. Yet the box
alone is meaningless: an empty container moves nothing, and a full one
unmanifested is just freight nobody can claim. The box means something
only woven in — declared to a fabric, kept by a loop, answering at a
face, owed to a principal. The container needed the shipping system;
the kube needs the weave; the box is the unit, never the point. But the
unit is how value is counted — like a box of chocolates, worth derives
from what the box holds and the size you choose: the kind says what is
inside, the class says how fine, the count says how much, and the meter
prices exactly that. And the meter reads to the piece: each
chocolate is priced — every task, every outcome, every unit of work
inside the box carries its own metered cost and its own receipt, so the
bill is itemized to the same grain as the evidence, and paying for the
box never means paying blind for what it holds. With one improvement on
the proverb: with this box, you always know what you are going to get —
it is declared on the lid, checked at the gate, evidenced on delivery,
and priced by the piece.

That is the whole value equation: the box with its spec plus the real
product inside. Spec without product is a brochure; product without
spec is freight no one can trust, price, or claim. Value lives in the
pairing — the declaration on the lid and the work inside it matching,
verdict-checked, every time. That pairing is what a kube is, and v0.1.0
is the first one on the shelf. Said most plainly: the box is the
packaging method — not the product, not the value, but the *way* value
is made carriable: how work is bounded, labeled, stacked, shipped,
priced, and claimed. Methods are judged by what they make possible, and
this one makes work tradable the way the container made cargo tradable:
same shape to every crane, every fabric, every buyer. And boxing is
what adds the three things raw work can never carry loose: provenance
(the manifest — where it came from, who touched it, every crossing
stamped), protection (the walls — sealed against tampering, isolated
from its neighbors, dry in any weather), and assurance (the
underwriting — a box that cleared the gate is a box someone stands
behind, with consequences priced in advance). Unboxed work is just
effort; boxed, it becomes an asset — locatable, defensible, insurable,
and therefore sellable. And unboxing belongs to the end user alone: the
box travels sealed — opaque to every carrier, crane, and intermediary,
including the platform itself, which stewards what it carries and owns
nothing it serves — and only the principal it is addressed to may open
it. Sovereignty at the seam: the addressee holds the keys, the manifest
proves the journey, and the seal proves no one else looked. And the seal is contractual, not
decorative: unboxing before delivery voids the contract — a box opened
by anyone but its addressee is a breach the moment it happens, the
chain of custody is broken, the assurance is forfeit by the breacher
and owed to the customer, and the breach itself is recorded evidence
(a broken seal cannot be hidden from the manifest). Tamper-evidence is
the enforcement: the contract does not ask intermediaries to be good;
it makes their interference visible, attributable, and expensive. And so every box carries one question
on its lid, asked before anything else and answered by proof, not by
assertion: *are you the end user?* It is the first question because it
gates all the others — what is inside, what it cost, what it promises —
and it is answered the only way this system answers anything: identity
resolved, authorization checked, the relation verified against the one
graph. Answer it rightly and the box opens to its owner; answer it
wrongly and the box stays sealed and remembers being asked. For the box
streams events — sealed about its contents, talkative about its
conduct: admitted, converging, ready, serving, scaled, touched, asked,
breached, exited — every transition emitted as it happens, in the open
standard for the purpose (CloudEvents, CNCF graduated), so any
authorized listener can follow the box's journey in real time without
ever seeing inside it. The manifest is the history; the stream is the
present tense; and both speak a wire anyone can subscribe to and no one
had to invent. The box has identity — its own name, unique and
independently resolvable, borrowed from no parent and surrendered to no
carrier: the name on the manifest, the subject of every event, the
party to its contract, the bearer of its reputation — and the name
survives the box, because the record remembers what the fabric has
released. And the box has bridges — it is not a cell but a port: every
opening in its walls is a declared crossing with a keeper — the face
where it serves, the stream where it speaks, the gate where it is
asked, the seam where it is unboxed — so that being sealed and being
connected are the same discipline: nothing crosses except over a
bridge, and every bridge is on the manifest.

And in the end, the box is an agent — the one who closes the loop. Not
a package containing an agent: the package *as* agent — it acts for a
principal (the addressee), where the principal is not (in transit, in
the cluster, at the edge), keeping a contract autonomously the whole
way. Watch its conduct and the identity is plain: it asks before it
opens, speaks as it travels, guards its own seam, converges to its
declaration, proves what it did, and exits leaving its name in the
record. "Closes the loop" in both senses at once: it runs the loop —
observe, compare, act, record — until declared and actual meet; and it
closes the loop with its principal — delivered, evidenced, accounted,
done only by verdict. The box and the agent were one subject all along:
an agent is a promise that can act; a box is a promise that can ship;
a kube is both — who reconciles to desired state: that is the whole
definition in five words, and the answer to "who does the work" at
every scale. The box reconciles its contents to its lid; the operator
reconciles the cluster to the declaration; the fabric reconciles the
worlds to the record; and each of them is the same answer to the same
question — not "what is it" but "who keeps it true." And desired state
is defined by the operator: the principal declares the *intent* — what
they want, in their own terms, on the lid; the operator defines the
*desired state* — the full concrete rendering of that intent into the
world's terms (every child, every default, every invariant the
declaration implies), which is exactly the expertise the operator
packages and the reason it exists. Three offices, cleanly split: the
principal declares, the operator defines, the loop converges — intent
is yours, its rendering is the operator's craft, and its keeping is
the loop's job. That is the product. The
unboxing is the customer's moment, and no one else's — which is the
name, completed: unboxd is not what we do to the box; it is what only
you can do to yours.

## Proof, not promises

Nothing here asks to be believed; everything names its verdict:

| Claim | Check it |
|---|---|
| It ships | [Release v0.1.0](https://github.com/unboxd-cloud/KubeContainer/releases/tag/v0.1.0) — image, install bundle, sha256 digests |
| It works in real clusters | The e2e gate: a declared workload must converge and serve HTTP 200 in a live cluster — every push, in CI |
| It will not break its word | The [golden compatibility corpus](internal/controller/testdata/compat/): era manifests must stay valid forever, CI-enforced |
| It carries its evidence | `eval-report.json` ships as a release asset — the [evaluation registry](eval/README.md)'s verdicts, attached |
| It is governed | The [charter](docs/FOUNDING-PRINCIPLES.md), the [lexicon and protocols](docs/AGENT-PLATFORM.md), and a vocabulary check that has already caught its own authors |

## Features

- **One CRD for the common case** — Deployment + Service + optional
  Ingress/HPA from a dozen lines of YAML.
- **Self-healing** — drift in any managed child is reverted by the reconcile
  loop; deleting the CR garbage-collects everything via owner references.
- **Safe scaling semantics** — fixed `replicas` or an `autoscale` block
  (mutually exclusive, enforced by CEL validation); under autoscaling the HPA
  owns the replica count and the operator never fights it.
- **Observable** — `Ready`/`Progressing`/`Degraded` conditions, events on
  every child change, and a computed `endpoint` in status:

  ```
  $ kubectl get kubecontainers
  NAME     IMAGE                     AVAILABLE   READY   ENDPOINT
  my-app   ghcr.io/acme/my-app:1.4.2 2           True    my-app.example.com
  ```

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: a Kubernetes v1.30+ cluster, `kubectl`, and (to build) Go and
Docker.

```sh
# Install CRDs and deploy the operator
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/kubecontainer:v0.1.0
make deploy IMG=<registry>/kubecontainer:v0.1.0

# Run a workload
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
kubectl get kubecontainers

# Tear down
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
make undeploy
```

Or install from the prebuilt bundle (CRDs, RBAC, and manager in one file):

```sh
kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
```

Notes:

- `expose.type: Ingress` requires an ingress controller in the cluster;
  `scaling.autoscale` requires metrics-server. Everything else works on any
  conformant cluster — the operator uses only stable upstream APIs.
- HPA scaling decisions need CPU `resources.requests` on the workload.

## Development

```sh
make build      # generate, fmt, vet, compile
make test       # envtest-based unit/integration suite
make lint       # golangci-lint
make run        # run the manager locally against your kubeconfig
```
