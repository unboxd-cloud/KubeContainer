# The Control Panel — Podman as Design Reference

The founder's pick: Podman as the design reference for the panel.
Podman is chosen for what it proves, not merely what it runs —
daemonless, rootless, fork/exec, open — and each property is a panel
law already in this house's doctrine:

| Podman property | Why it is the reference | The panel law it grounds |
|---|---|---|
| Daemonless | no always-on root daemon mediating everything (the Docker model, struck) | the panel is not a privileged server that owns the box; it issues declarations and exits — command as code, no resident master |
| Rootless | containers run as the invoking user, not root | the user owns all the faces: the panel acts as the logged-in principal, least privilege, never a god-daemon |
| fork/exec, no broker | each container a child process, directly owned | one custodian per resource: the panel launches and the OS owns; no broker holding everyone's processes hostage |
| Pods (the namesake) | groups of containers sharing a context | the kube: a declared group with one record, one face |
| Docker-compatible CLI/API | speaks the standard, invents no lock-in | the panel speaks the conformance contract (kube CRD, OCI, k0s) — adapters, not proprietary wires |
| systemd/Quadlet units | containers declared as units, not imperatively run | Config As Code: every panel action is a declaration on the record, idempotent, diffable |

## What the panel is (v0, the edge-as-UI-ref)

One screen, served surface-native (site/panel.html is the seed):

1. Login — the principal arrives; the panel acts as them, never above them (rootless).
2. Point at a server — the declared ground (the VPS, k0s on it).
3. One resident per row, one button each — GitLab, zot, the site kube, an agent: each row a declaration (the skeleton already in registry/SKELETON.json and deploy/*.yaml), the button an apply, no imperative script.
4. Live verdicts — each row shows its state from the cluster's own truth (kubectl get under the hood), the way Podman shows container status — observed, not asserted.
5. No resident daemon — the panel renders, issues the declaration, and the loop (the operator) keeps it; the panel can close and the kube stays kept. Daemonless, exactly as Podman taught.

## The boundary (honest, recorded)

The panel issues declarations and reads verdicts; it never becomes
the keeper. The operator keeps, k0s runs, the panel only declares and
observes — so closing the panel changes nothing that was converged.
That is the daemonless law: the control plane is the cluster, not the
panel; the panel is a face, and faces present, they do not rule.

## The market gap (the opening)

The founder's finding, recorded as the reason to build: a pod-native
panel is not there. The kube-native control surfaces that exist are
thin — Headlamp has very few options, the dashboards assume you
already speak kubectl, and the easy panels (Coolify and kin) are
Docker-native, not pod-native, and bring the daemon this house
struck. So the seat is open: an easy, pod-native, daemonless panel —
Podman's model at the cluster scale, the kube as the unit, the
operator as the keeper. The gap is the product; this is why we build
rather than adopt.

## The trick — one app, many envs, the operator may differ

Proven by hack/operatorpoc (rehearsal chamber): one application
declaration (arithmetic) moves through the gates into two
environments; the operator keeps it to each env's own policy (dev: 1
replica, prod: 3). Same app, two envs, two views — and the operator
need not be the same in each. That is the panel's central trick: the
application is the constant that travels; the operator is the variable
that keeps. The founder's design, recorded fragment by fragment:

- Podman Desktop to kube-cloud — the panel spans the desk to the
  cloud in one app, one browser: the local (Podman-model, the desk)
  and the cluster (the kube-cloud) both visible in one surface, the
  way Podman Desktop shows local containers — but reaching all the
  way to the cloud's pods, not stopping at the laptop.
- One nav menu — everything is one navigation: no separate
  consoles per env, per server, per registry. One menu, the whole
  estate.
- Each view tells its env clearly — every panel, row, and
  resource is labeled with its environment, unmistakably: which env,
  always on the face, so two views of one app are never confused.
- Multi-server, single operator — one operator can keep an app
  across many servers; the app can sit at any level (desk, edge,
  estate). The operator is the constant keeper; the servers and
  levels are where it keeps.
- Past history preserved — every env, every move through the
  gates, keeps its history: the record is append-only, so the panel
  shows not just the present view but the journey — what each env
  was, when it changed, who moved it (the manifest, on the face).

## The path, and the gap

The path Podman creates — Podman → zot → kind → the Kubernetes panel
(the kube dashboard): the desk container engine to the open registry
to the local cluster to the cloud panel, one continuous road from
laptop to estate. And the gap the founder names to fill gradually:
Podman has no hub like Docker Hub — no first-class, trusted,
discoverable registry-with-a-face the way Docker Hub is for Docker.
That hub is the registry strategy this house already declared (the
registry defines the contract; zot the store; the panel the face) —
the gap is the opening, and the panel is where it gets filled.

## Crossplane as reference — the gates as another view

Point of reference, founder-supplied (CNCF, incubating):
https://www.cncf.io/projects/crossplane/ — Crossplane makes the
cluster the control plane for everything (infra, services, apps) via
CRDs and compositions; the panel takes from it the principle that one
declarative control plane governs every layer, not just workloads.

And the build/deploy gates are another view in the panel: alongside
the env views (dev, prod) sits the pipeline view — the application
moving through its gates (build, test, security, promise, deploy),
each gate's verdict on the face, the same app tracked from source to
served. Two axes in one nav: across environments (where it runs) and
along the gates (how far it has passed).

The path is configurable as a flow: the gates an app moves through
are not fixed but declared — a flow the operator (or its env-specific
keeper) walks, editable in the panel, recorded like every
declaration. Different apps, different flows; the panel renders
whichever flow the app declares.

And the flow engine can be Temporal: durable, replayable workflow
execution (the gate-walk as a workflow that survives restart, retries
on failure, preserves its history) — a candidate seat for the flow
runtime, measured against the house's own loop-and-record discipline,
recorded as a candidate the way every pick is.

## The watcher and the reconciler — two seats, not one

The founder splits the flow's two offices cleanly:

- A watcher observes that the flow completes — a monitoring seat
  (Cortex named as the candidate: CNCF, the horizontally-scalable
  metrics/observability project — it watches and alerts that the
  flow reached its end, the gates all green, the deploy served). The
  watcher sees; it does not act.
- The kube is the reconciler — the keeper that closes the distance
  to the declaration, the office this whole house was built on. The
  flow declares the desired path; the kube reconciles toward it; the
  watcher confirms it arrived. Three roles, never confused: the flow
  declares, the kube reconciles, the watcher witnesses.

This is the loop's own anatomy mapped onto the panel: observe (the
watcher), compare and act (the reconciler/kube), record (the
append-only history). The panel shows all three at once — the
declared flow, the reconciling kube, the watcher's verdict that it
completed — so a human reads, in one nav, what was wanted, what is
being kept, and whether it landed.
